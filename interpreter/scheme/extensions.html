  <h2>Scheme Interpreter Extensions</h2>

  <p>There are many ways to extend our Scheme interpreter. A few suggestions are
  below, and the <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29">Wikipedia</a>
  page for Scheme is a good place to start to learn more about the language
  itself.</p>

  <p>We recommend that you submit the final version of your project before
  attempting any of these extensions. <b>We are not responsible if you break the
  required components of your interpreter and Scheme code.</b></p>

  <h3>Variable Arguments</h3>

  <p>Many Scheme implementations allow procedures to take in a variable number
  of arguments, which get placed into a list before being bound to a parameter.
  (Compare to Python, where variable arguments are placed into a tuple.) This is
  specified by preceding the last parameter with a dot (much like
  Python's <code>*</code>):</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (define (add . args) (apply + args))
    add
    scm&gt; (add 3 7 2 1)
    13
  </pre>

  <p>Recall that a dot is used to specifiy the second component of a pair. Thus,
  formal lists can now be ill-formed.</p>

  <p>In order to implement this, you will need to change the following:
  <ul>
    <li><code>check_formals</code> should not reject a formal list that is just
      a symbol or terminated by a symbol rather than <code>nil</code>.
    <li><code>Frame.make_call_frame</code> should bind the remaining list of
      values to the symbol that terminates <code>formals</code>, if it is not
      terminated by <code>nil</code>.
  </ul></p>

  <h3>Quasiquote and Unquote</h3>

  <p>Quoting prevents the interpreter from evaluating an expression. Often times,
  we might want to evaluate part of an expression but not the rest. For example,
  the following constructs a list containing the symbol <code>a</code> and its
  value:</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (define a 3)
    a
    scm&gt; `(a , a)
    (a 3)
  </pre>

  <p>The backquote (<code>`</code>) specifies a <emph>quasiquote</emph>, which
  can evaluate parts of an expression. A comma (<code>,</code>) is
  an <emph>unquote<emph>, which specifies that the next expression should be
  evaluated. Finally, a comma followed by an at symbol (<code>,@</code>) is
  an <emph>unquote-splicing</emph>, meaning that it evaluates the next
  expression, which must evaluate to a list, and then splices that list into the
  result:</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; `(a ,@ '(1 2 3) 4)
    (a 1 2 3 4)
  </pre>

  <p>Quasiquotes can be nested, and an unquoted expression should only be
  evaluated if it is at the same nesting level as the outermost quasiquote. The
  nesting level increases by one in each quasiquotation and decreases by one in
  each unquote/unquote-splicing.</p>

  <p>Here are some examples from the Scheme R5RS reference manual:</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; `(list  ,(+ 1 2)  4)
    (list 3 4)

    scm&gt; (let ((name 'a)) `(list ,name ',name))
    (list a (quote a))

    scm&gt; `(( foo ,(- 10 3)) ,@(cdr '(c)) . ,(car '(cons)))
    ((foo 7) . cons)

    scm&gt; `(a `(b ,(+ 1 2)  ,(foo ,(+ 1 3)  d)  e)  f)
    (a (quasiquote (b (unquote (+ 1 2)) (unquote (foo 4 d)) e)) f)

    scm&gt; (let ((name1 'x)
               (name2 'y))
           `(a `(b ,,name1  ,',name2 d)  e))
    (a (quasiquote (b (unquote x) (unquote (quote y)) d)) e)
  </pre>

  <p>The tokenizer already handles quasiquotes and unquotes. However, you will
  need to modify <code>scheme_read</code> to handle them as well, like you did
  for normal quoting. Use the
  strings <code>"quasiquote"</code>, <code>"unquote"</code>,
  and <code>"unquote-splicing"</code>, respectively.</p>

  <p>In addition, the following changes are required:
  <ul>
    <li>Add a case in <code>scheme_eval</code>
      and/or <code>scheme_optimized_eval</code> for <code>"quasiquote"</code>:
      call a new <code>do_quasiquote_form</code> function. You may also want
      to check for <code>"unquote"</code> and <code>"unquote-splicing"</code>
      here, raising an error that they are being used outside of a quasiquote.
    <li>You will need to process a quasiquote recursively. If a value is a list
      that starts with either unquote at the right nesting level, then the list
      should contain only one more value, which should be evaluated in the
      current environment and returned. Otherwise the value should be returned
      without being evaluated.
    <li>Splicing is a bit more complicated, since the splicing needs to be done
      by the caller. You may want to add another return value to specify whether
      or not splicing should be done. Use <code>scheme_append</code> to actually
      do the splicing.
  </ul></p>

  <h3>Macro Definition</h3>

  <p>Macros allow the language itself to be extended by the user. Simple macros
  can be provided with the <code>define-macro</code> special form. This must be
  used like a function definition, and it creates a procedure just
  like <code>define</code>. However, this procedure has a special evaluation
  rule: it is applied to its arguments without first evaluating them. Then the
  result of this application is evaluated.</p>

  <p>Here is a simple example:</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (define-macro (when test . branch)
           (list 'if test (cons 'begin branch)))
    when
    scm&gt; (when (< 3 4)
            (print 1)
            (print 2))
    1
    2
    okay
  </pre>

  <p>The code above defines a macro <code>when</code> that evaluates all the
  expressions in its body when the predicate expression is true. (You'll need to
  have implemented variable argument lists for this particular example to
  work.)</p>

  <p>In order to implement <code>define-macro</code>, add a <code>macro</code>
  parameter to <code>do_define_form</code>, with a default value
  of <code>False</code>. If <code>macro</code> is true, raise an error if
  function definition shorthand is not used. Otherwise, mark the resulting
  procedure as a macro. (There are many ways to do this; one way is to use an
  instance attribute.)</p>

  <p>In <code>scheme_eval</code>, add a case for <code>"define-macro"</code>
  that calls <code>do_define_form</code> with <code>macro</code> as true. Then
  modify the procedure handling code to check if a procedure is a macro. In that
  case, it should apply the procedure directly to the arguments without
  evaluating them first. It should then evaluate and return the result.</p>

  <h3>Mutation</h3>

  <p>Like Python, Scheme has non-local assignment. In particular,
  the <code>set!</code> special form takes in a name and another expression and
  rebinds that name to the value of the expression in the first frame in which
  the name exists. Unlike Python, this frame can be the local or global
  frame.</p>

  <p>In order to implement <code>set!</code>, add a method to <code>Frame</code>
  that rebinds a name to a new value in the first frame in which the name is
  found. An error should be raised if the name does not exist in any frame. You
  will also need to add a <code>do_set_form</code> function and a case for
  <code>set!</code> in <code>scheme_eval</code>.</p>

  <p>Pairs can be mutated using <code>set-car!</code> and <code>set-cdr!</code>
  These can be easily implemented as primitive procedures
  in <code>scheme_primitives.py</code>.</p>

  <h3>Library Code</h3>

  <p>Many standard Scheme procedures can be implemented in Scheme itself, as
  library code. Add a mechanism to your interpreter to load up a library file on
  startup (e.g. <code>scheme_lib.scm</code>). Then provide useful procedures in
  <code>scheme_lib.scm</code>, such as <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>,
  and <code>c*r</code> variants up to four applications of <code>car</code>
  or <code>cdr</code>.</p>

  <h3>Error Handling</h3>

  <p>Currently, when an error occurs while attempting to evaluate an expression,
  the interpreter only prints out an error message, with no backtrace. This
  makes it difficult to determine the source of an error.</p>

  <p>In order to provide a useful backtrace, start by adding names to primitive
  procedures and procedures defined using the special <code>define</code> syntax.
  Use default names, such as <code>[lambda]</code>, for procedures with unknown
  names.</p>

  <p>Now write a new function to handle an exception and call it from the first
  except clause in <code>read_eval_print_loop</code>. A Python exception
  contains information about every frame between the one that raised the
  exception and the one that handled it. If <code>e</code> is an exception,
  then <code>e.__traceback__</code> is a <code>traceback</code> object that
  contains this information. A <code>traceback</code> is a recursive list
  of <code>frame</code>s. Read more about <code>traceback</code>,
  <code>frame</code>, and <code>code</code> objects
  <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.2/reference/datamodel.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>A Python exception contains information at the Python level, but a user is
  interested in information at the Scheme level. So you should translate the
  Python-level information to Scheme-level information by extracting the latter
  from a <code>frame</code>. You can read the local variables in
  a <code>frame</code>, and you can obtain its associated <code>code</code>
  object to get the name of the Python function for that <code>frame</code>.<p>

  <p>Some suggestions on what to do with a Python frame:
  <ul>
    <li>If the frame corresponds to <code>scheme_apply</code>, then add an
    entry to your Scheme trace for the associated procedure call. Use the
    name attribute that you added previously, and include the arguments.

    <p>If you did the tail recursion optimization, you will not
    call <code>scheme_apply</code>. Instead, keep track of the last known
    procedure call in <code>scheme_optimized_eval</code>, and add an entry for
    that to your Scheme trace when the frame corresponds
    to <code>scheme_optimized_eval</code>.
    <li>If the frame corresponds to a <code>do_*_form</code> function, then
    add an entry to your Scheme trace with the name of the form and its original
    arguments.
    <li>Number the entries in your trace and display them in whichever order you
    prefer.
  </ul>

  <p>Here are some sample traces without the tail recursion optimization:</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (define (foo x) (/ 1 x))
    foo
    scm&gt; (define (bar x) (foo x) 3)
    bar
    scm&gt; (define (baz x) (if (= x 0) (bar x) (baz (- x 1))))
    baz
    scm&gt; (foo 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      0     (foo 0)
      1     (/ 1 0)
    Error: division by zero
    scm&gt; (bar 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      0     (bar 0)
      1     (#begin (foo x) 3)
      2     (foo 0)
      3     (/ 1 0)
    Error: division by zero
    scm&gt; (baz 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      0     (baz 3)
      1     (baz 2)
      2     (baz 1)
      3     (baz 0)
      4     (bar 0)
      5     (#begin (foo x) 3)
      6     (foo 0)
      7     (/ 1 0)
    Error: division by zero
  </pre>

  <p>With the tail recursion optimization:</p>

  <pre>
    scm&gt; (foo 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      0     (foo 0)
      1     (/ 1 0)
    Error: division by zero
    scm&gt; (bar 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      0     (bar 0)
      1     (#begin (foo x) 3)
      2     (foo 0)
      3     (/ 1 0)
    Error: division by zero
    scm&gt; (baz 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      0     (bar 0)
      1     (#begin (foo x) 3)
      2     (foo 0)
      3     (/ 1 0)
    Error: division by zero
  </pre>

  <h3>Further Extensions</h3>

  <p>Feel free to implement any other features of Scheme that you want. You can
  read the full reference manual
  <a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/r5rs.pdf">here</a>.
  Examples include named
  lets, <code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>, <code>do</code> loops, strings,
  and vectors. (If you really want a challenge, then try to
  implement <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>, which isn't even
  handled correctly by STk.) How close can you get to what STk provides?</p>
